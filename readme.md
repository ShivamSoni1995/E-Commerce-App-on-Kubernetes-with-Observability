Of course. Here is the GitHub repository draft formatted as a standard response.

### **GitHub Repo: Online Shopping Webapp Deployment on Kubernetes**

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to deploying a pre-built online shopping web application frontend on a Kubernetes cluster. It covers two deployment approaches: the traditional Deployment/Service method and an alternative method using a hypothetical `kubernetes-mcp` server. Additionally, it includes instructions for setting up observability using the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart.

**Prerequisite:** You should have a pre-built application container image hosted on a container registry like Docker Hub.

### **2. Kubernetes Deployment**

We provide two methods for deploying your application to a Kubernetes cluster. In the following YAML files, make sure to replace `your-dockerhub-image:latest` with the actual path to your image on Docker Hub (e.g., `myusername/my-shopping-app:1.2.0`).

#### **2.1. Traditional Deployment (Deployment/Service)**

This is the standard and most common way to deploy applications on Kubernetes.

**`kubernetes/traditional/deployment.yaml`**:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shopping-app-deployment
  labels:
    app: shopping-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shopping-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shopping-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: shopping-app
        image: your-dockerhub-image:latest # <-- IMPORTANT: Replace with your image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**`kubernetes/traditional/service.yaml`**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: shopping-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: shopping-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

To deploy, apply these manifests:
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/traditional/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/traditional/service.yaml
```

#### **2.2. Alternative Deployment (kubernetes-mcp)**

This method uses a hypothetical `kubernetes-mcp` (Multi-Cluster/Cloud Platform) server, which simplifies deployment across multiple environments.

**`kubernetes/mcp/mcp-deployment.yaml`**:
```yaml
apiVersion: mcp.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: shopping-app-mcp
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: shopping-app
        image: your-dockerhub-image:latest # <-- IMPORTANT: Replace with your image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  placement:
    clusters:
    - name: cluster-1
    - name: cluster-2
```

To deploy using `kubernetes-mcp`, you would use the `mcp` CLI:
```bash
mcpctl apply -f kubernetes/mcp/mcp-deployment.yaml
```

### **3. Observability with Kube-Prometheus-Stack**

The `helm` directory contains a script to install the `kube-prometheus-stack`, which provides a full-featured monitoring and observability solution.

**`helm/install-prometheus.sh`**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Add the prometheus-community Helm repository
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

# Update your local Helm chart repository cache
helm repo update

# Install the kube-prometheus-stack chart
helm install prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring --create-namespace
```

Run this script to set up your monitoring stack:
```bash
bash ./helm/install-prometheus.sh
```
